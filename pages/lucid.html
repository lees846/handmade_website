        <p>
            Sometimes I’m not convinced that we’ve gotten it right. What if our true awake is when we’re sleeping? All of these stick and stone things cause us stress and make us sick in “real life,” while <a href="dreams.html">dreams</a> get brushed away. Maybe we just make it all up. Even the lovely things, like a cherry blossom spring or the view of a hundred mountains from the highest peak. Or a smile; a hug.

            I think if I was always <a href="dreams.html">dreaming</a>, I would make up wonderful things, too.
