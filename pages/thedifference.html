        <h1>The Difference</h1>
        <p>
            Why can’t we <a href="dreams.html">dream</a> together? Is <span class="italics">that</span> what awake is? Is awake a <a href="dreams.html">together-dream</a>? Maybe that’s the only real difference between the two - quantity. Maybe there’s only one <a href="dreams.html">awake dream</a> but 7.8 billion possible <a href="dreams.html">asleep dreams</a> for any given moment. What if all <a href="dreams.html">asleep dreams</a> were at the same time? Together?
