        <h1>A Dream from April 21 </h1>

        <p>
            I had this crazy <a href="dreams.html">dream</a> once where I was getting my wisdom teeth removed. You may guess that with a <a href="dreams.html">dream</a> like this, something would go horribly wrong at the dentist, but the surgery seemed to go smoothly.

Perhaps there was a notification, or maybe we just knew to check. Regardless, on Twitter was a note from our Governor:

            “Today we extend the closure of K-12 schools... through the end of the school year.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            Was I wrong? Sports, prom, graduation... had those been merely <a href="dreams.html">dreams</a>?   
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't seem to wake up from this one. Even 2 years later.
