        </h1>
        <p>
            Are you awake? Are you sure? If you’re awake, is that what makes you alive? The thesaurus seems to think so. Then why are “wakes” about someone who’s dead?  
        </p>
        <p>
            Or the wake of a boat or a duck; the wake is the water left <span class="italics">behind</span>, swirling and dodging the event which disturbed it. Is that how we live when we’re a-wake? Are we <span class="italics">the</span> wake? Do we watch the dead and dance in the undertow of the things we can’t control?  
        </p>
        <p>
            Who gets to be the boat?
