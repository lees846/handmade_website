    <p>
        One definition of “asleep” is “into the state of death.” What dies while you sleep? More importantly, what <span class="italics">lives</span> or is born anew? I think (can I think when I’m asleep?), I think <a href="dreams.html">dreams</a> can make you <span class="italics">alive</span>, just as awake can. Not comatose, not slumbering, not languid, not <span class="italics">dead</span> said in a “nice way.” No. In my <a href="dreams.html">dreams</a>, I feel alive. I know I’m alive.

        Who can live without sleep anyways?
