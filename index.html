        <h1>Awake and Asleep</h1>
        <p>
            “Awake” has some obvious definitions, but it can also mean “to realize something,” “to cause to remember.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember my dreams when I wake up, I remember my life when I sleep. Yet, these two words - “awake,” “asleep” - are antonyms.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not sure we’re <a href="pages/a-wake.html">awake</a> to the definition of “<a href="pages/out.html">asleep</a>”.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are sure, I challenge you; <a href="pages/contradiction.html">think again</a>.
